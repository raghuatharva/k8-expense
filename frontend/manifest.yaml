      # Why the Capability?

      # On Linux, binding to ports below 1024 (like port 80) requires elevated privileges. Since your Dockerfile sets the user to nginx (a non-root user), nginx doesnâ€™t have permission by default.

      # Adding NET_BIND_SERVICE:
      # The added line in the security context:
      # securityContext:
      #   capabilities:
      #     add:
      #       - NET_BIND_SERVICE

      # This instructs Kubernetes to grant the container the ability to bind to privileged ports. This way, even though nginx runs as the non-root nginx user, it can still bind to port 80.
